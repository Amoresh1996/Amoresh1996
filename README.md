## Project Overview

This project is built using **C#** for the application logic and **SQL Server** as the database management system. It provides [brief description of the project's functionality, e.g., a management system, web API, etc.].

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: Core application logic and features.
- **SQL Server**: Backend database management.
- **.NET Framework/.NET Core**: (specify which one, if applicable).
- Other dependencies or libraries used (if any).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amoreshsarkar/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Restore the required NuGet packages:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore  # if using .NET Core/Framework
    ```

3. Configure the **SQL Server** connection string in the `appsettings.json` (or another configuration file) to match your local database setup.

4. Run database migrations (if applicable):
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update  # For Entity Framework, if using migrations
    ```

## Usage

1. Build and run the project:
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```

2. Access the application through your local server (usually at `http://localhost:5000` or a port specified in your project).

3. You can interact with the backend APIs or the user interface depending on the nature of the project.
